# 10: The field bridge

**Operating rule:** any software is fine as long as it cannot interfere with Cheesy Arena actually
controlling the field. Reading data for overlays is fine. Accidentally stopping a match or
corrupting game-piece scoring is not.

That's a much better bar than "don't mutate anything," because it's the one that actually matters,
and because Cheesy Arena's code splits along exactly that line.

---

## The safety boundary is structural, not a promise

`websocket.HandleNotifiers()` **never calls `Read()`**. It selects over notifier channels, writes
outbound frames, and pings every 10s to detect a dead client. That's the entire loop.

So any handler whose body is `ws.HandleNotifiers(...)` is **incapable of processing anything we
send.** Not "won't," *can't*. We could fire arbitrary frames at it all weekend and nothing would
be read. That is a far stronger guarantee than a code review of our own client.

Command-capable handlers are the ones with a read loop, and they are exactly the ones that can hurt
the event:

| Endpoint | Commands it accepts | Why it's forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/match_play/websocket` | `startMatch`, **`abortMatch`**, `loadMatch`, `substituteTeams`, `toggleBypass`, `commitAndPost`, `discardResults`, `startTimeout`, `signalReset`, … | **Literally stops a match.** Also discards results |
| `/panels/scoring/{position}/websocket` | **`autoTower`**, **`endgame`**, **`addFoul`**, `commitMatch` | **Literally is game-piece scoring.** Corrupts the official score |
| `/panels/referee/websocket` | fouls, cards | corrupts the official score |
| `/alliance_selection/websocket` + POSTs | picks, finalize, reset | destroys alliance selection |
| `POST /setup/*` | everything | `POST /setup/db/clear/{type}` and `/setup/db/restore` **wipe or replace the event database** |

## The allowlist

Hard-coded in the client. Not a config file, not a convention: a constant, with a unit test that
fails if anything else appears.

**Allowed (WebSocket, all `HandleNotifiers`-only, verified):**

| Endpoint | Gives us |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/arena/websocket` | `matchTiming`, `matchLoad`, `matchTime` |
| `/displays/audience/websocket` | `realtimeScore`, `scorePosted`, `lowerThird`, `audienceDisplayMode`, `allianceSelection`, `playSound`, `matchLoad`, `matchTime` |
| `/displays/queueing/websocket` | queueing + `eventStatus` |
| `/displays/field_monitor/websocket` | `arenaStatus`: station health, robot comms. Powers the "what happened to 846?" replay marker |
| `/displays/rankings/websocket` | live rankings |
| `/displays/bracket/websocket` | playoff bracket state |

**Allowed (HTTP, `GET` only):**
`/api/matches/{type}` · `/api/rankings` · `/api/alliances` · `/api/teams/{id}/avatar` ·
`/api/bracket/svg` · `/api/sponsor_slides`

**Forbidden: everything else**, and specifically every path in the table above.

### Verifying a new endpoint before adding it

One command. If it prints nothing, the handler cannot read from us:

```bash
sed -n '/WebsocketHandler/,/^}/p' web/<name>.go | grep -n '\.Read(' || echo SAFE
```

Do this for any endpoint someone wants to add in September. It takes ten seconds and it's the
whole safety argument.

## Client rules

1. **Receive-only websockets.** Our WS client never sends an application frame. Protocol-level
   pong is handled by the library; nothing above that layer can write. Belt-and-suspenders on top
   of the structural guarantee.
2. **`GET`-only HTTP, enforced in the wrapper.** The client physically cannot construct another
   method. `POST /setup/db/clear/matches` is one typo away from ending the event; make it
   unreachable rather than merely unwise.
3. **Path allowlist checked at call time**, against the constant above. Reject and log, don't warn.
4. **Reserved `displayId`, coordinated with the scorekeeper.** This is now the top *real* risk:
   registering with an ID a genuine audience display uses could reconfigure that display. Agree
   `contentdesk1`…`contentdesk4` (or whatever they prefer) in advance, and always pass it
   explicitly. Connecting without one makes Cheesy allocate an ID and redirect.
5. **Connection budget:** one WS per allowed endpoint, one concurrent HTTP request. The schedule
   and rankings poll every 60s, plus one deferred refresh about 1.5s after a posted score so the
   side screens are not a minute behind the room. There is no faster polling mode.
6. **Exponential backoff with jitter, 1s → 60s.** A reconnect storm during a field reset is now
   the most plausible way this project causes a problem. There is no circuit breaker beyond the
   60s cap: the bridge keeps retrying at that ceiling until the kill switch or the operator stops
   it.

## The one remaining way we could actually interfere

Not the API. **The host**.

Cheesy Arena is a *single Go process* that runs the web server, the arena loop talking to driver
stations, PLC I/O, and LED/DMX output. Starve that process of CPU, disk, or NIC and you are
genuinely affecting field control.

So:

- **Never run any of our software on the FMS machine.** Not the bridge, not OBS, not a "small"
  helper script. The bridge is our box.
- **Don't co-locate our recording or encoding** anywhere near it (those are the I/O-hungry ones).
- Our UPS, our power, our switch. If our rack browns out, the field doesn't notice.
- Keep the field-side NIC quiet: no default gateway, no DNS, and disable NetBIOS/LLMNR/mDNS/network
  discovery on that adapter. Windows will otherwise broadcast discovery chatter across the field
  network all weekend. It won't stop a match, but it's free to avoid.
- **Kill switch**, documented and rehearsed: `Disable-NetAdapter -Name "Field" -Confirm:$false`, or
  pull the cable. Everything downstream degrades to manual and keeps running.

## What the relaxed constraint buys us

Registering as a display was the blocker on live data, and it's now in scope. That restores:

- **Live in-match score** on the broadcast, `authoritative`, not a shadow-scorer guess.
- **`score.delta` synthesis** → automatic replay markers for scoring bursts, lead changes, and
  climbs (see [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md)). This was the single highest-value derived
  signal in the design and it's back.
- **`arenaStatus`** → "robot dropped" markers and a station-health strip on the desk console.
- **`playSound` / `audienceDisplayMode`** → our cue engine can follow the scorekeeper's screen
  changes instead of guessing at them.

It also means the rest of the stack is unconstrained: OBS, vMix, NodeCG, Companion, ffmpeg,
whatever fits. The only line is the allowlist above.

## Validation against a real Cheesy Arena

Done, on a local `cheesy-arena -dev` build of the 2026 source. `harness.mjs` at the repo root
stands in for the scorekeeper and referees so a genuine match runs with genuine scoring; the bridge
itself never touches those control endpoints.

```bash
node harness.mjs
```

**Result:** the desk tracked a full match, with every phase transition, correct countdown, endgame
lockdown at exactly `matchClock` 110, real scores (auto climb → 15, teleop L2 → 20, L3 → 30) and
the correct final. Reconnect backoff was separately verified against a dead host: 24 attempts
across six sockets in twelve seconds, no spin, desk healthy throughout.

It also found three bugs that synthetic tests could not have:

1. **Hub alternation was inverted.** Cheesy's `Hub.isShiftActive` returns `!WonAuto` for
   Shift 1/3 and `WonAuto` for Shift 2/4. Winning auto buys the *later* shifts.
2. **The auto winner is decided on AUTO FUEL COUNT ALONE.** Tower climbs don't count. An alliance
   can score 15 auto points from a climb and still lose auto, which our total-score heuristic got
   backwards.
3. **A tied auto is settled by a coin flip**: `if redAutoFuel == blueAutoFuel { redWonAuto =
   rand.Intn(2) == 1 }`. There is nothing to derive. This is what makes taking hub state from the
   field *mandatory* rather than merely tidier: any local inference is wrong half the time whenever
   auto ends level.

The bridge now reads hub state from Cheesy's per-alliance `ActiveRemainingSec` and only falls back
to inference when running desk-only.

### Rehearsing without a field

`harness.mjs` needs a real `cheesy-arena -dev` build. When one isn't at hand, `npm run fake-arena`
serves the real wire protocol instead: the same allowed display websockets, the same `{type, data}`
frames, the same GET-only REST paths, looping a scripted match (robots linking, auto decided on
fuel, alternating hub shifts, endgame climbs, score posting). `npm run validate:offline` drives the
whole bridge against it headless and prints a PASS/FAIL checkpoint table. It's the same hardened
client, the same allowlist, and the same adapter as the real thing; nothing on our side is stubbed.
Good for catching a regression in September without waiting on the next chance at an actual field.

## Verify before October

- [x] Run the whole ingest against a local `cheesy-arena -dev` instance through a real match
- [x] Repeatable offline regression check (`npm run fake-arena` + `npm run validate:offline`) that
      exercises the same client, allowlist, and adapter without needing a live Cheesy Arena build
- [ ] Re-run `harness.mjs` against the actual off-season build being used at the event, in case it
      differs from `main`
- [x] Unit test asserting the endpoint allowlist (`cheesy.test.ts`: refuses control sockets,
      permits only the listener sockets, refuses REST paths outside the read allowlist). It fails
      if anyone adds a `/panels/` or `/match_play/` path.
- [ ] Unit test asserting the HTTP client rejects every method except `GET`.
- [x] Kill Cheesy Arena mid-match; confirm we back off cleanly instead of hammering.
- [ ] Wireshark the field NIC for five minutes; confirm nothing but allowlisted traffic. Bring the
      capture to the FTA conversation (more persuasive than any promise).
- [ ] Agree the reserved `displayId` with the scorekeeper, in writing.
- [ ] Rehearse the kill switch.
