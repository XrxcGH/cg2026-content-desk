/**
 * One-time Spotify authorization: turns a client id into a refresh token you
 * can paste into config.json.
 *
 *   npm run auth:spotify
 *
 * Authorization Code with PKCE, which is the only flow that fits here.
 * Implicit Grant was sunset in November 2025, and the plain client-secret flow
 * would put a permanent credential on a laptop that volunteers carry around a
 * gym for no benefit. PKCE needs no secret at all.
 *
 * The redirect URI is 127.0.0.1 and not localhost, and that is not a style
 * choice: Spotify rejects `localhost` by name, requires HTTPS for anything
 * that is not a loopback address, and permits plain HTTP only for an explicit
 * loopback literal. So the browser leg has to happen ON the machine running
 * this, which is worth knowing before somebody tries it from a phone.
 *
 * The token is NOT written to config.json. You paste it, so nothing here ever
 * writes a secret to disk on its own.

Spotify authorization
---------------------
This links the desk to the account that plays the event's house music.

Before you start:

  1. The account must be Spotify PREMIUM. Remote control does not work on a
     free account, and as of 2026 the developer app's owner needs Premium too.
  2. Create an app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
  3. Add this EXACT redirect URI to it:  ${REDIRECT}
     (Spotify rejects "localhost" by name. It has to be the 127.0.0.1 form.)
  4. In the app's Settings > User Management, add the Spotify account that
     will play the music. Development-mode apps only work for accounts listed
     there, and an account that is missing fails with a 403 later rather than
     a clear message now.

Run this on the machine you are sitting at: the browser step only works from
this computer, because 127.0.0.1 means "here".

Done. Paste these into config.json under "audio" > "spotify":

Then set "deviceName" to the name the music machine's Spotify shows under
Connect (its computer name, usually), and "playlistUri" to the event playlist:
right-click the playlist in Spotify, Share, Copy link, and keep the id, or use
the spotify:playlist:... form.

Two things to write on the run sheet:

  - This token expires SIX MONTHS from today, whether or not it gets used, and
    refreshing does not extend it. If the event is more than six months out,
    re-run this closer to the day.
  - config.json is gitignored. Keep it that way: this token controls playback
    on that Spotify account.
