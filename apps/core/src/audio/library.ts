/**
 * The house clip library: walk-up songs and stingers.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the music service. A playoff introduction needs a
 * specific twelve seconds of a specific track to start on the beat the
 * announcer hands over, and a streaming service is the wrong instrument for
 * that: it needs the internet to be up, it starts when it feels like starting,
 * and skipping to a cue point is a second round trip. A file on the disk of the
 * machine wired to the PA plays instantly, plays the same way every time, and
 * plays when the venue uplink is down. Alliance introductions are the moment
 * with the least tolerance for "it'll start in a second".
 *
 * Files live in `media/audio/walkups` and `media/audio/stingers`. A walk-up is
 * named for the team it belongs to: `254.mp3`, or `254 - Chariots of Fire.mp3`
 * if whoever loaded it wanted the title visible on the desk. Everything else is
 * a stinger and is picked by name.
