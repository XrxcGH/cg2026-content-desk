/**
 * Day-VOD chapters.
 *
 * The community asks for the full uncut day recording, and then asks how to
 * find match 42 in seven hours of it. The event log already knows: every
 * `match.start` is a timestamp, and `match.loaded` right before it carries the
 * name. Give the operator the wall-clock moment the stream recording began and
 * this turns the log into text that pastes straight into a YouTube description.
 *
 * YouTube's rules are strict and silent about failure, so they are enforced
 * here rather than discovered later on a live VOD:
 *
 *   - the first chapter must be at 0:00
 *   - there must be at least three chapters
 *   - every chapter must run at least ten seconds
 *   - they must be listed in ascending order
 *
 * Break any one of them and YouTube shows no chapters at all, with no error.
